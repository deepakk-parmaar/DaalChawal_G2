      "Here are 10 feature sets with descriptions of problematic aspects, derived from the provided negative review phrases: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Usability and Mobile Experience**: Users have encountered issues with the website's usability, especially on mobile devices. Admin mode and certain functionalities seem to be problematic, impacting the overall user experience and making it cumbersome to manage the platform on the go. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cost and Pricing Plans**: Several users find G2 to be expensive, particularly for startups or smaller businesses. The cost of accessing certain features and the need for higher-tier plans to utilize advanced functionalities are common concerns. Some also mention that justifying the ROI can be challenging. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lead Generation and Quality**: While G2 promises lead generation, some users are disappointed with the quality and volume of leads received. They find the leads to be highly unqualified or difficult to integrate into their existing systems, questioning the value of G2 for lead gen. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Integration Challenges**: Integrating G2 data into other systems, such as Marketo or Salesforce, seems to be a common pain point. Users want smoother integrations, especially with buyer intent data, to make the most of the platform. The current process is seen as time-consuming and complex. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **User Interface and Navigation**: Some users find the G2 interface confusing and not user-friendly. They experience challenges navigating the platform, and certain features are hard to locate or use effectively. This hinders the overall user experience and adoption of the platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Review Process and Criteria**: The review process and criteria used by G2 have raised concerns. Users find it hard to submit reviews, with lengthy surveys and confusing qualification questions. The mathematical algorithm used for star ratings and grid standings could benefit from more transparency. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Reporting and Analytics**: While G2 offers reports and analytics, some users desire more detailed explanations of the methodologies and algorithms used. The current level of insight may not be sufficient for advanced analysis or competitive intelligence purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Support and Responsiveness**: Although most users praise G2's support team, a few have experienced delays or a lack of resolution to their issues. Ensuring timely and effective solutions to user problems is crucial for maintaining user satisfaction. \n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Data Accuracy and Comparisons**: Some users question the accuracy of data presented for competitor comparisons. They suggest that G2 should provide more granular insights and raw user data to support businesses in making informed decisions. \n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Onboarding and Learning Curve**: A few users mention a steep learning curve with G2, particularly when it comes to understanding and navigating the platform's various features and functionalities. Enhancing the onboarding process and providing clearer guidance could improve the initial user experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "These feature sets highlight areas where users have encountered challenges or expressed dissatisfaction. Addressing these concerns could help improve the overall user experience and perception of the platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can continue to identify and describe problematic areas based on the provided review phrases if you would like a more comprehensive list of feature sets to address.\n"
